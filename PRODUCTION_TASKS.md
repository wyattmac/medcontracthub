# 🚀 Production Readiness Tasks

**Current Status: 75% Complete** | **Target: 100%**

This document tracks the remaining tasks to reach 100% production readiness for MedContractHub.

## 🚨 New Critical Issues Discovered (January 6, 2025)

Based on senior developer review, the following critical issues were discovered:

### Test Infrastructure Crisis
- **Only 6.14% test coverage** (production needs 50% minimum)

- Missing integration tests for Stripe, SAM.gov, and AI features

### Security Vulnerabilities
- `.env` file with actual API keys is tracked in git

## 🎯 Completion Criteria

Each task should be marked complete only when:
1. Implementation is finished
2. Tests are written and passing
3. Documentation is updated
4. Code is reviewed and merged

## 📝 Adding New Issues

When working on tasks, add newly discovered issues to the appropriate priority section:

**Example**: While fixing test infrastructure, you might discover:
- Other API routes still using old patterns
- Mock utilities that need updating
- Test files with outdated imports
- Missing test coverage in related areas

→ Add these to the task list immediately to ensure comprehensive fixes.
