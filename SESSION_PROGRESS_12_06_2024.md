# Session Progress - December 6, 2024

## Summary
Continued production readiness tasks from Priority 1 (Security) through Priority 2 (Fix Failing Tests). Made significant progress on test infrastructure but encountered timeout issues with complex tests.

## Completed Tasks ✅

### Priority 1: Security & Environment (COMPLETE)
1. **Remove .env from git** 
   - Verified .env is not tracked in git
   - Updated .gitignore with jest-cache and puppeteer directories

2. **Fix CSRF Security**
   - Removed hardcoded fallback secret in `/lib/security/csrf.ts`
   - Added proper error handling for missing CSRF_SECRET
   - Environment variable now required in production

### Priority 2: Fix Failing Tests (PARTIAL)

#### 2.1 Migrate API routes to routeHandler (COMPLETE)
Successfully migrated all 6 identified routes:
- ✅ /api/opportunities/save
- ✅ /api/opportunities/saved  
- ✅ /api/opportunities/sync
- ✅ /api/sync/manual
- ✅ /api/sync/status
- ✅ /api/opportunities/search (already migrated)

All routes now use consistent:
- Zod validation schemas
- Custom error types
- Rate limiting
- Sanitization options

#### 2.2 Fix test infrastructure (PARTIAL)
Completed:
- ✅ Created global mocks in `__tests__/setup/mocks.ts`
- ✅ Fixed Response.json mock errors
- ✅ Updated test utils for routeHandler pattern
- ✅ Added usage tracking mock for AI endpoints
- ✅ Mocked Next.js cookies() function
- ✅ Fixed Supabase server client mocking
- ✅ Created test helpers in `__tests__/utils/test-helpers.ts`

Still needed:
- ❌ Fix timeout issues in complex tests
- ❌ Update all existing API tests to use new mocks
- ❌ Fix Jest configuration for Next.js 14

## Key Files Modified

### Security Fixes
- `/lib/security/csrf.ts` - Removed hardcoded secret

### API Route Migrations
- `/app/api/opportunities/save/route.ts`
- `/app/api/opportunities/saved/route.ts`
- `/app/api/opportunities/sync/route.ts`
- `/app/api/sync/manual/route.ts`
- `/app/api/sync/status/route.ts`

### Test Infrastructure
- `/__tests__/setup/mocks.ts` - Centralized mock configuration
- `/__tests__/utils/test-helpers.ts` - Helper functions for tests
- `/jest.setup.js` - Import global mocks

## Issues Discovered

### Test Timeout Problem
- Complex API tests are timing out after 10 seconds
- Simple validation tests pass
- Appears to be related to async operations in route handlers
- May need to mock database connection test in Supabase server client

### API Response Format
- Error responses follow a consistent format with `code`, `message`, `requestId`
- Tests need to check for this format rather than raw error strings

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Immediate (Priority 2 continuation)
1. Investigate and fix test timeout issues
2. Update all API tests to use new mock patterns
3. Add test helpers for common scenarios

### Priority 3: Core Stability
1. Add AbortController to useAuth hook
2. Add cleanup for all async operations  
3. Create error boundary components

### Priority 4: Performance & Scale
1. Create database indexes
2. Configure Redis for production
3. Set up connection pooling env vars

## Production Readiness Status
- **Before Session**: 87%
- **After Session**: 88%
- **Blockers**: Test coverage (6.14%), test timeouts, memory leaks

## Commits Made
1. "feat: Complete Priority 1 security fixes and API route migrations"
2. "feat: improve test infrastructure with global mocks"

## Time Spent
- Priority 1 (Security): ~1.5 hours
- Priority 2 (Tests): ~4 hours
- Total: ~5.5 hours

## Notes for Next Session
- Start by investigating why `createClient()` in tests is causing timeouts
- Consider mocking the database ping test in Supabase server client
- May need to create a simpler mock specifically for tests vs production code
