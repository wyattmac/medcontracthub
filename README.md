## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wyattmac/medcontracthub.git
cd medcontracthub
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set up environment variables

Copy the example environment file and fill in your values:

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Required environment variables:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase anonymous key
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: Your Supabase service role key
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Your Anthropic API key
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`: Google OAuth client ID
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`: Google OAuth client secret

### 4. Set up the database

Run the database migrations:

```bash
npm run db:reset
```

Generate TypeScript types from your database:

```bash
npm run db:types
```

Seed the database with sample data:

```bash
npm run db:seed
```

### 5. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the application.

### MCP Servers

This project uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for enhanced development:

- **GitHub MCP**: Version control and collaboration
- **Filesystem MCP**: File operations and management
- **Context7 MCP**: Library documentation and best practices research

**Important**: Always research patterns using Context7 before implementing new features. See [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) for detailed MCP usage guidelines.

### Code Style

- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ESLint configuration for Next.js
- Prettier for code formatting
- Conventional commits for version control

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

The application uses Supabase Auth with a complete authentication flow:

1. **Sign Up**: Users create an account with email/password
2. **Onboarding**: Multi-step process to collect:
   - Personal information (name, phone, title)
   - Company details (name, NAICS codes)
   - Business certifications (SDVOSB, WOSB, etc.)
3. **Protected Routes**: Middleware ensures only authenticated users access dashboard
4. **Session Management**: Automatic session refresh and cookie-based auth

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run unit tests
npm test

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e
```
