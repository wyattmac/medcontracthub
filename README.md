## 🔍 Senior Developer Team Review (June 2025)

### Production Readiness Assessment

Our senior development team conducted a comprehensive code review. Here are the key findings:

#### 🎯 Overall Score: 85/100 (Production Readiness: 85%)

**✅ What's Working Well:**
- **Virtual Scrolling**: Successfully handles 22k+ opportunities without browser crashes
- **Comprehensive Security**: CSP headers, CSRF protection, input sanitization
- **Error Handling**: Structured error system with custom types and logging
- **Database Performance**: Optimized queries with proper joins, no N+1 issues
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Complete GitHub Actions setup with staging environment
- **Stripe Integration**: Full billing system with usage metering and webhooks
