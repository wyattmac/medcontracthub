## 🔄 Deployment Workflows

### 1. **Feature Development**
```
Feature Branch → PR → CI Tests → Review → Merge to develop
```

### 2. **Staging Deployment**
```
Merge to develop → CI Pipeline → Build Images → Deploy to Staging → Smoke Tests
```

### 3. **Production Release**
```
Merge to main → CD Pipeline → Blue-Green Deploy → Health Checks → Traffic Switch → Monitoring
```

### 4. **Emergency Rollback**
```
Detection → Automatic Rollback → Alert Team → Post-mortem
```
